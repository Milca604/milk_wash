Our problem for every plans we come up with is lack of execution.

I propose to set timeline to help with execution.
The purpose of this is to have small, but reachable goals, so we keep working at it.
When the goal seems too big or too far away, break it down.

That being said, due to unforeseeable reasons such as lack of knowledge, 
some of the dates can be later altered.

Let’s start with a list of things that has to be accomplished in order.
Then, we will set the dates.

List of tasks:

Decide direction of how to go
Discuss about timeline to refine number of tasks (ongoing)
Learn about database program and implementation
Come up with parameters to be implemented in the program
Flow chart to illustrate python code structure (ongoing)
Coding (to be separated into segments to code) (need to be clearly defined but updated regularly)

How to use SQLite 
 Read documentation for SQLite
how to import into SQLite
script to process and organize imported data
SQLite3 as database
SQLiteman as database GUI

Python 3
 install Python 3
 Learn Python 3
  What’s different with python 2
 
Find SQlite API

Delivery
 Testing, debugging
 teaching them how to use it 

Find database hosting
 Domain registration - that support SQLite
 

2015 Aug 14: Drink and discuss timeline. Breaking down tasks was a success. 8 beers drank.
2015 Aug 17: Find out the major differences between Python 2 and Python 3.
2015 Aug 19: Learn 2 useful things in Python 3. Put in Git.
2015 Aug 21: Questions about things learned. Talk about what to do next week.



2015 Aug 28: Flow chart should be done, General idea of how data base and python work together should be obtained.
