Our problem for every plans we come up with is lack of execution.

I propose to set timeline to help with execution.
The purpose of this is to have small, but reachable goals, so we keep working at it.
When the goal seems too big or too far away, break it down.

That being said, due to unforeseeable reasons such as lack of knowledge, 
some of the dates can be later altered.

Let’s start with a list of things that has to be accomplished in order.
Then, we will set the dates.

List of tasks:
Discuss about timeline to refine number of tasks (ongoing)
Learn about database program and implementation
Come up with parameters to be implemented in the program
Flow chart to illustrate python code structure (ongoing)
Coding (to be separated into segments to code) (need to be clearly defined but updated regularly)


2015 Aug 14: Drink and discuss timeline.

2015 Aug 21: In a week’s time, what should we accomplish.

2015 Aug 28: Flow chart should be done, General idea of how data base and python work together should be obtained.
