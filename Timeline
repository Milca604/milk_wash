Our problem for every plans we come up with is lack of execution.

I propose to set time line to help with execution.
The purpose of this is to have small, but reachable goals, so we keep working at it.
When the goal seems too big or too far away, break it down.

That being said, due to unforeseeable reasons such as lack of knowledge, 
some of the dates can be later altered.

Letâ€™s start with a list of things that has to be accomplished in order.
Then, we will set the dates.

List of tasks: (Place task under each week respectively)
01- Discuss about time line to refine number of tasks

02- Learn about database program and implementation (sqlite3)
	a- read official document
	b- create memo(notes)
	c- learn sqlite3 GUI (sqliteman)

03- Come up with parameters to be implemented in the program

04- Flow chart to illustrate python code structure
	a- blue print of milk_wash

05- Coding (to be separated into segments to code) (need to be clearly defined but updated regularly)
	a- Body of milk_wash

06- Import data
	a- learn converting procedure (Excel->sqlite3)
	b- Input data
	c- Confirm data accuracy

06- test run
	a- HK entry mode
	b- Backstage maintenance mode
	c- Marketing material mode
